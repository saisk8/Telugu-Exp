        About the experiment
      </h4>
      <hr />
      <p>
        We often look for differences in our surrounding objects to establish a sense of uniqueness
        that is associated with each of these objects. The experiment is designed to understand how
        the visual cortex differentiate objects. We, therefore, choose a subset of Telugu characters
        for this behavioural experiment, wherein, we ask participants to rate the characters based
        on their perceived dissimilarity between the glyphs that are displayed.
        <br />
        <br />
        We do not expect participants to read, speak, or write the Telugu language. How such a
        participant with no knowledge of the language perceives differences is the point behind the
        experiment. People who know Telugu are also encouraged to participate in the experiment as
        it will be interesting to compare the perceived dissimilarity of such participants against
        the participants who have no idea of the language.
        <br />

      <ul>
        <li>
          You will be shown a pair of Telugu characters for a duration of <b>2</b> seconds, after
          which they disappear.
        </li>
        <li>You are required to rate the pair, in terms of their <b>Dissimilarity</b>.</li>
        <li>Once you have rated the pair, click the next button, to get a new pair</li>
        <li>30 pairs make up a set. You will have to attempt 10 such sets.</li>
        <li>The estimated time of completion for 10 sets is about <b>25 minutes</b>.</li>
